// Description:
// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

// My Solution:
// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
    room1: {
        name: "firstRoom",
        description: "This is the first room",
        completed: true
    },
    room2: {
        name: "secondRoom",
        description: "This is the second room",
        completed: false
    },
    room3: {
        name: "thirdRoom",
        description: "This is the third room",
        completed: false
    }
}
