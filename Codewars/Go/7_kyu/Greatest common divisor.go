// Description:
// Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.

// The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.

// My Solution:

func Gcd(x, y uint32) uint32 {
    if y == 0 {
      return x
    } else {
      return Gcd(y, x % y)
    }
}
